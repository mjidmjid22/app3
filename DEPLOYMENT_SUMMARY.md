- ✅ Local `.env.local` for development
- ✅ Dynamic API configuration
- ✅ MongoDB connection strings updated

### Server Improvements
- ✅ Added connection timeout handling
- ✅ Improved error logging
- ✅ Built TypeScript to JavaScript
- ✅ Railway deployment ready

### Database Setup
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas configured
- ✅ IP whitelist updated
- ✅ Test user creation script ready

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Complete authentication system overhaul"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Auto-Deploy
- Railway will automatically deploy from GitHub
- Monitor deployment in Railway dashboard
- Verify at: https://app2-production-8eea.up.railway.app

### 3. Create Test Users
After Railway deployment, run:
```bash
node server/create-test-users.js
```
This creates:
- Admin: admin@test.com / admin123
- Worker: 12345 / 12345
- Supervisor: 67890 / 67890

### 4. Test Expo App
```bash
npx expo start
```
- Scan QR code with Expo Go
- Test login with created accounts
- Verify all functionality

## 🔧 For Local Development
Use `.env.local` file for local testing:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.113:5000
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
```

## 📱 Production App
The app will automatically use Railway backend when deployed through Expo.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Test users must be created after each fresh database
- Local IP (192.168.0.113) is only for development
- Production uses Railway URL automatically
- MongoDB Atlas is shared between local and production

## 🎉 You're Ready!
All systems are configured and ready for deployment. The authentication issues have been resolved and the app should work seamlessly across all environments.
